            Helios, the original personification of the sun in Greek mythology, drove his four-horse chariot across the sky daily before Apollo assumed this role.

Similar chariot-driving solar deities appear in Norse (Sól), Hindu (Surya), and Celtic traditions, indicating ancient Indo-European solar worship patterns. He possessed all-seeing vision from his celestial position, could blind enemies with solar flares, his horses breathed fire, and his chariot's path determined the length of days and seasons across the mortal world.

Celtic smith-gods like Brigid and Germanic Wayland the Smith share similar attributes, reflecting the sacred nature of metalwork in ancient cultures.

His story appears in various forms from Celtic hero tales to Germanic warrior epics, showing the universal appeal of the tragic invincible hero. His divinely-forged armor and weapons could pierce any defense, his speed in battle was supernatural, and his battle-fury could inspire terror in entire armies, though his famous heel remained his fatal weakness.

            Pandora's Box, the source of all evil released into the world while hope remained trapped inside, appears in Greek mythology as humanity's first great mistake. Similar "forbidden knowledge" myths appear as Norse Odin's sacrifice for wisdom, Hebrew Tree of Knowledge, and Hindu Daksha's sacrifice, reflecting universal themes about the cost of curiosity. The box contained all manner of plagues, diseases, and sorrows that had never before afflicted humanity. Once opened, it could never be closed again, but hope's presence at the bottom suggested that even in darkness, redemption remains possible.

        <div class="image-placeholder">
            Tech noir cyberpunk masterpiece TCG art, an epic fantasy illustration of digital chains made of pure darkness binding cyber-entities.

        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Tartarus, the deepest pit of the Greek underworld, served as prison for the Titans and the most heinous criminals of both mortal and divine realms. Similar underworld prisons appear as Norse Náströnd, Celtic Annwn, and Hindu Naraka, suggesting universal concepts of ultimate punishment. The chains of Tartarus were forged by the Cyclopes and could bind even gods. These supernatural restraints could hold beings of any power level, grew stronger with the prisoner's struggles, fed on despair and guilt to maintain their binding force, and could only be broken by acts of genuine redemption or divine intervention.
        </div>
        <div class="effect">Effect: When an opponent's Beast or Hero declares an attack: Negate that attack and bind it. That card cannot attack again until the end of your opponent's next turn.</div>

        <div class="image-placeholder">
            Tech noir cyberpunk masterpiece TCG art, an epic fantasy illustration of a reflective digital surface showing distorted justice imagery.

Make the background a hall of mirrors with fractured reality reflections. Style: Dark and gritty, cinematic lighting, explosive energy, detailed character and creature design.
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Nemesis's mirror showed mortals their true nature and the consequences of their actions, serving as both judgment tool and instrument of divine retribution. Similar justice-mirrors appear in Egyptian judgment halls, Celtic cauldrons of rebirth, and Hindu karma-reflecting pools. The mirror could not lie or be deceived by any illusion. It revealed the moral weight of every action, reflected attacks back at their source with increased power based on the attacker's guilt, showed possible futures based on current choices, and could force viewers to confront the full consequences of their deeds across multiple lifetimes.
        </div>
        <div class="effect">Effect: Negates an attack and deals that attack's damage to opponent.</div>

            Tech noir cyberpunk masterpiece TCG art, an epic fantasy illustration of a collapsing digital tower with warning sirens.

Make the background a crumbling cyber-cityscape with falling data-blocks. Style: Dark and gritty, cinematic lighting, explosive energy, detailed character and creature design.
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            The Tower card in tarot represents sudden upheaval, destruction of false beliefs, and divine judgment against hubris. Similar tower-destruction myths appear as Biblical Babel, Hindu cosmic destructions, and Norse Ragnarök, reflecting universal fears of overreach and collapse. The Tower's lightning strike represents sudden enlightenment that destroys illusions. It could sense when mortals grew too proud or powerful, manifest as natural disasters or divine intervention, strip away all false pretenses and accumulated power, and force complete rebuilding from honest foundations.
        </div>
        <div class="effect">Effect: If opponent summons a beast stronger than any of yours on field, destroy it instantly.</div>

        <div class="description">
            Soul harvesting represents the ultimate violation in most mythologies - the theft of one's essential essence and afterlife prospects. Similar soul-stealing entities appear as European vampires, Slavic soul-eaters, and Mesopotamian demons who consumed the life force of mortals. Death gods like Hades, Hel, and Mictlantecuhtli controlled the fate of harvested souls. Soul harvesting could grant the practitioner increased power and extended life, steal memories and abilities from victims, prevent natural death and rebirth cycles, and trap consciousness in eternal servitude to the harvester's will.
