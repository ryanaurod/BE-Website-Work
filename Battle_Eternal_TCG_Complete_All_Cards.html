Born from Izanagi's cleansing ritual, his violent nature led to conflicts with his siblings and exile from heaven. His defeat of the eight-headed dragon Yamata-no-Orochi to save Princess Kushinada established him as a protector despite his chaotic nature. He commands typhoons, lightning storms, and floods, can manifest as a towering warrior wreathed in tempest, and his sword Kusanagi became one of Japan's three imperial regalia.

Her mythology parallels sun deities across cultures, from Egyptian Ra to Celtic Brigid, suggesting ancient universal reverence for solar divinity. When she hid in a cave after Susanoo's rampage, the world plunged into darkness until the other gods lured her out with mirrors and sacred dances. She radiates life-giving solar energy, can heal with her divine light, controls day and night, and her sacred mirror Yata-no-Kagami reveals truth and dispels illusions.

Similar chariot-driving solar deities appear in Norse (Sól), Hindu (Surya), and Celtic traditions, indicating ancient Indo-European solar worship patterns. He possessed all-seeing vision from his celestial position, could blind enemies with solar flares, his horses breathed fire, and his chariot's path determined the length of days and seasons across the mortal world.

        <div class="description">
            Nemesis, the relentless goddess of divine retribution and righteous vengeance, ensured that hubris never went unpunished in Greek mythology. Romans called her Nemesis as well, and similar justice deities appeared in Egyptian (Ma'at) and Norse (Forseti) pantheons, showing universal human need for cosmic justice. She particularly targeted those who grew arrogant from good fortune, restoring balance through swift punishment of the proud and protection of the humble. Her divine scales weighed the moral worth of mortals, she could manifest anywhere injustice occurred, commanded the Furies as her agents, and her sword could cut through any defense when delivering earned punishment.

Terra Mater in Roman tradition and earth goddesses across all cultures reflect universal reverence for the living planet as divine mother. From Celtic Danu to Hindu Prithvi, earth mothers appear in every mythology as the source of all life and ultimate nurturer. She could cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, birth new species at will, communicate through all living things, and her body was literally the earth itself, making her immortal and omnipresent across the natural world.

            Hephaestus, the lame god of fire, metalworking, and craftsmanship, forged the weapons and treasures of the gods in his volcanic workshop beneath Mount Etna. Known to Romans as Vulcan, his cult spread wherever metallurgy and craftsmanship flourished, from Greece to Gaul and Britain. Celtic smith-gods like Brigid and Germanic Wayland the Smith share similar attributes, reflecting the sacred nature of metalwork in ancient cultures. He could craft items of impossible beauty and power, control volcanic forces, animate golden servants, and his hammer strikes could shape reality itself, making him indispensable despite his humble appearance.

His story appears in various forms from Celtic hero tales to Germanic warrior epics, showing the universal appeal of the tragic invincible hero.
